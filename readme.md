Player must complete O R E targets again to start mode again on next turn or ball.

Runs until qualification for select quest is completed by hitting the required shots.

#### Quest Modes

All quest modes have similar start and stop rules.  The quest selected in the select quest mode starts when selected, or the 3 special attack front gate quests start automatically after completing 2 other quests (every 3rd quest).  They run until the quest is complete and progress is maintained across balls and turns.  You cannot fail at a quest, other than to end the game.  Each quest has unique shots to complete.  Each quest has an achievement that is rewarded when the quest is complete.

##### Attack Front Gate 1, 2, 3

Every 3rd quest will automatically be this special quest which cannot be selected, it just automatically starts after the player completes 2 other quests.  Other than this, and the unique shots, it is the same as other quest modes.  Hit front gate shots to complete this quest.
